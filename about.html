                </h3>
                <p class="tm-mb-5">
                  <strong>I am passionate about using data and evidence to inform decision making,
                    make a positive impact on programs and policy, and ultimately, improve communities. </strong>
                </p>
                <p class="tm-mb-5">
                  Growing up on the southside of Chicago, my parents carted my brothers and I to just about every
                  museum free day and low-cost program at the local library and park.
                  My dad, a Chicago police officer, brought home our first computer when the high school where he was
                  stationed as a school resource officer replaced the machines in their computer lab. We weren't living
                  in poverty,
                  but my parents were definitely thrifty. We were never in too much of a hurry to slow down the car to
                  consider the discarded furniture in the alley (aka 'The Big Store'). These values - <strong>humility,
                    resourcefulness,
                    practicality</strong> - inform not only my personal worldview, but also my professional philosophy.
                  <br />
                  <br />My research and evaluation practice emphasizes principles of human-centered design. I strive to
                  apply a participatory
                  and stakeholder-driven approach in all my work. I believe that projects that intentionally elevate
                  stakeholders and community
                  members as the experts of their context are both more accurate and generate more usable insights.
                  Practically speaking,
                  this lends itself to mixed methods of data collection and advocacy for the integration of community
                  voices into ongoing
                  continuous quality improvement efforts.
                  <br />
                  <br />I understand that every dollar spent on research and evaluation is a dollar less available to
                  run your programs.
                  I am committed to making my services accessible to organizations with budgets of various sizes and am
                  happy to barter in exchange.
